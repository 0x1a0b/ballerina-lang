Ballerina makes it easy to write microservices that integrate APIs.

#### Integration Syntax
A compiled, transactional, statically and strongly typed programming language with textual and graphical syntaxes. Ballerina incorporates fundamental concepts of distributed system integration and offers a type safe, concurrent environment to implement microservices.

#### Networked Type System
A type system that embraces network payload variability with primitive, object, union, and tuple types.

#### Concurrency
An execution model composed of lightweight parallel worker units that are non-blocking where no function can lock an executing thread manifesting sequence concurrency.

## Ballerina by Example

[Ballerina by Example](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/) teaches you the Ballerina language incrementally with commented examples that cover every nuance of the syntax. The source for these can be found in this repository.

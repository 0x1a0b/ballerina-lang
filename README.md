# Ballerina Composer

The Ballerina Composer provides a flexible and powerful tool for creating your Ballerina programs. You can build your integrations by creating sequence diagrams, dragging elements from a tool palette onto a canvas. As you build the diagrams, the underlying code is written for you, which you can work with in the Source view. You can also use the Swagger view to define services by writing Swagger definitions. You can switch seamlessly between the Design view, Source view, and Swagger view and create your programs in the way that you like to work. 

**You can create your integration in Design view:**

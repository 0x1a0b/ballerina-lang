NAME
    Ballerina help run - Run Ballerina program source files, 
    binaries, or packages

SYNOPSIS
     ballerina run [-e] [--offline] [--observe]
         [--sourceroot] [-c|--config] [-B] 
         <balfile | packagename | balxfile> [args...]  

DESCRIPTION
     Run command executes the given program or package. 

     If a Ballerina source file (.bal file) or a source package is 
     given, the run command compiles and runs it. The compilation 
     is done internally and does not generate a binary file. 
 
     You may use the Ballerina build command to compile a source and 
     provide the generated binary file (.balx file) to the run command. 
     The binary runs much faster than a source file, because the source 
     file run requires a compilation phase. 

     You must have either a main function or a service(s) or both in
     order to run a program or a package. When both the main function
     and services are present, run executes services first and then
     executes the main function.

OPTIONS
     -e <key1=value1, key2=value2, …>
         Sets Ballerina environment parameters as key, value pairs.

     --offline
         In a package build, the dependencies are always checked from 
         the remote repository (Ballerina Central) to check for latest 
         artifacts. If --offline is given, this remote check is not 
         done and the local artifacts will be used instead. 

     --observe
         Enables observability for the Ballerina program and lets
         users observe it through Jaeger (tracing) and Prometheus
         (metrics) by default. If --observe is given, it will display
         a log mentioning push/pull endpoints that will be used for
         Jaeger and Prometheus. Moreover, default configurations of
         Jaeger and Prometheus can be overridden using environment
         parameters or by defining them in ballerina.conf.

     --sourceroot <path>
         Provides the path to be taken as the root of the source. 
         Source will be looked up relative to the given source root 
         path.

     -c <config-file>
     --config <config-file>
         Provides path to the Ballerina configuration file. 

     -B <option1, option2, …>
         Provides a list of Ballerina VM options to be used by runtime 
         when executing a Ballerina program or package. This accepts a 
         comma-separated list of options.

     args... 
         The list of command line arguments for the Ballerina program 
         being run. The semantics of these arguments are defined by 
         the program design. 

DEFAULT BEHAVIOR
     Runs the main function in the given program or package.
     If no main function is defined, it will look for a service. 
     If no main function or service is present, the run command will fail.   

EXAMPLES
     Run hello source program  
     $ ballerina run hello.bal

     Run hello binary program  
     $ ballerina run hello.balx

     Run hello package  
     $ ballerina run hello

     Run math package with three program args: add, 10, and 5
     $ ballerina run math add 10 5

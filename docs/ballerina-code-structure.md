# How to Structure Ballerina Code

A Ballerina file is structured as follows:

```
[package PackageName;]
[import PackageName [version ImportVersionNumber] [as Identifier];]*

(ServiceDefinition |
 FunctionDefinition |
 ConnectorDefinition |
 TypeDefinition |
 TypeMapperDefinition |
 ConstantDefinition)+
```

Note: Terminals of the language (keywords) are lowercase, whereas non-terminals are uppercase.

Each of the Ballerina entities such as services and connectors are described in detail in their own pages in this guide.

A Ballerina program can consist of a number of Ballerina files, which may be in one or more packages. Ballerina uses a modular approach for managing names and organizing code into files. In summary, Ballerina entities (functions, services, etc.) all have globally unique qualified names consisting of their package name and the entity name.

# How to Write Ballerina Code

[Ballerina](http://ballerina.io/) is a general purpose, concurrent and strongly typed programming language with both textual and graphical syntaxes, optimized for integration. It is designed to make it easier to write programs that integrate with data sources, services, and network-connected APIs of all kinds. Although it is optimized primarily for such programs, it can be used to program anything. However, it is recommended to use Ballerina if a significant portion of the program is related to integrating with data sources, services, or network-connected APIs.

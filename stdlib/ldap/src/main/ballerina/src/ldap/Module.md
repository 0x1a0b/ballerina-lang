This module provides an inbound LDAP authentication provider, which is used to authenticate using LDAP credentials.

The `ldap:InboundLdapAuthProvider` is another implementation of the `auth:InboundAuthProvider` interface. This connects to an active directory or an LDAP, retrieves the necessary user information, and performs authentication and authorization.

For information on the operations, which you can perform with this module, see the below **Functions**. For an example on the usage of the operations, see the [Secured Service with LDAP Example](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/secured-service-with-ldap.html).
